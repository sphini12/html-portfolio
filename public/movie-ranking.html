<h3>Holw's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>One of the reasons I love this movie is its imaginative and whimsical world-building. The moving castle itself is a marvelous creation, and it's fascinating to see how the characters interact with it.</p>
<p>"It's Been A Pleasure Meeting You,<br /> Even If You Are My Least Favorite Vegetable."</p>
<p>Sophie, To Turnip-Head</p>
<h3>Five feet apart</h3>
<p>What resonates with me about this movie is its heartfelt portrayal of human connection and resilience. The two main characters, Stella and Will, navigate the complexities of their condition while developing a deep bond.</p>
<p>"This whole time I've been living for my treatments,<br /> instead of doing my treatments so that I can live. And I wanna live."</p>
<p>Stella</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>What stands out to me is how creatively the movie visualizes and personifies emotions as characters inside Riley's mind. It's a thought-provoking exploration of how our emotions shape our experiences and decisions. </p>
<p>"They Came To Helpâ€¦ Because Of Sadness."</p>
